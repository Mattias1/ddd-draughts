        I made this site to play around with the concept of Domain Driven Desing (DDD).
        This way I can try out ideas without affecting production code. As such this is
        released under the MIT license on
        <a class="extern" href="https://github.com/Mattias1/ddd-draughts">github</a> and
        you are free to play around with the code yourself and learn from it what you can.
