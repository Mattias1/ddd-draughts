Domain-driven design and Draughts
==================================
This is a little webapplication where people can come and play a game of Draughts (or Checkers if
you like).
The goal of this project is:
- To experiment and play with the DDD architecture
- To serve as an example of how to apply DDD in a real application
- To teach others what DDD is
- To play a fun game of Draughts


Documentation
--------------
The documentation is a part of the application. You can find the link to the
[documentation](http://localhost:52588/documentation) in the footer after you run it, or you can
look at the [source code](/Draughts/Application/Documentation/Views) of the docs.


Setup
------
Ehhh, open it in visual studio and hit F5. It should open at http://localhost:52588.
**WIP**.
